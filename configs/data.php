define('ABOUT_ME', 
    "Hi, my name is Yohanes Cahyadi. I'm a programmer and have a passion for building things.
    at the start of learning programming i was skeptical but soon discovered the joy of computing and also realized how useful this skill could be for showing off my best waste creations to the world.
    Since then I've learned various languages and frameworks and built more to-do lists then I can count. It's always gratifying to learn together in groups and help each other as well as partaking in a rabbit hole with fellow students because everyone comes up with unique questions and unique approaches to solve them.
    <br><br>
    A huge motivation behind building this portfolio website was to be able to showcase my projects, so feel free to browse the projects section to check out what I've built, shoot me an email or connect on linkedIn.");
